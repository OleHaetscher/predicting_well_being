    """
    Custom GroupKFold class with shuffling and random state support.

    This class extends the functionality of group-based cross-validation by adding the ability to shuffle groups
    before splitting. The groups are shuffled based on the provided random state to ensure reproducibility.

    Attributes:
        n_splits (int): Number of splits/folds for cross-validation.
        shuffle (bool): Whether to shuffle the groups before splitting.
        random_state (Optional[int]): Seed for the random number generator for shuffling.

        Generate indices to split data into training and test sets based on group labels.

        This method implements group-based cross-validation where samples in the same group
        are kept together in the training or test sets. If shuffling is enabled, group labels
        are shuffled before splitting into folds.

            y (Optional[np.ndarray]): Target vector of shape (n_samples,). Not used, present for compatibility.
            groups (Optional[np.ndarray]): Group labels for the samples of shape (n_samples,). Determines the grouping
                for the splits. Each unique value in `groups` represents a distinct group.

        Returns:
            Iterator[Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]]: An iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains:
                - `train_indices` (np.ndarray): Indices for the training set.
