    """
    Feature selector based on Pearson correlation.

    This class selects features based on their Pearson correlation with the target variable.
    It allows for:
    - Selecting a fixed number of top features based on absolute correlation.
    - Selecting features whose correlation exceeds a specified threshold.

    NOTE: Feature selection is not included in the final version of this paper.

    Attributes:
        num_features (Optional[int]): Number of top features to select based on absolute correlation.
        correlation_threshold (Optional[float]): Minimum absolute correlation to consider a feature informative.
        target_prefix (str): Prefix used to identify features for selection based on correlation.
        selected_features_ (Optional[list[str]]): List of selected feature names after fitting.
